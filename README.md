# Pixel Grid

An interactive pixel grid application that creates beautiful light patterns and effects.

## Features

- **Dynamic Lighting Shapes**: Choose from different lighting patterns:

  - Circular: Traditional distance-based lighting that fades from the touch point
  - Linear: Gradient lighting from left to right
  - Radial: Lighting that radiates from the center of the grid
  - Random: Random intensity for each cell, creating a scattered effect

- **Multi-Color Options**: Select from various color modes:

  - Single: One base color theme (traditional)
  - Gradient: Colors transition smoothly across the grid
  - Random: Each cell picks a random color from a customizable palette

- **Interactive Features**:

  - Sound Effects: Subtle sounds play when interacting with the grid
  - Haptic Feedback: Vibration on touch (on supported devices)
  - Particle Effects: Small animations burst from touched cells

- **Customizable Grid**:
  - Adjustable cell size and interaction radius
  - Multiple pattern options (dots, lines, waves, etc.)
  - Theme selection with built-in and custom themes
  - Auto-wave animation with multiple wave sources
